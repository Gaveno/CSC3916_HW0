## Homework 0 for WebAPI class
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/fc52ef8ececd8329ac37)
### NOTE: the second request may or may not be correct. On my machine it has the line "tests["book id"] = id === pm.environment.get("id");" but when I click this button sometimes it doesn't have the line so I don't know what's going on with postman. I tried re-sharing the collection multiple times.
